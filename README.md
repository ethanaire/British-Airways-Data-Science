# British Airways Data Science

## Project Context:

**Lounge access** is a key part of the premium travel experience, and understanding lounge demand is crucial for British Airways (BA) to maintain high standards while optimizing space and resources. As the airline plans for future operations at Heathrow Terminal 3, itâ€™s important to anticipate demand across different types of lounge access, each associated with varying levels of customer loyalty and travel class.

As BA plans for the future, especially with changes in flying schedules and fleet strategy, it's important to _forecast how many passengers will be eligible to use each lounge on a typical day_. However, future schedules can be unpredictable, which means we need a modeling approach that is both flexible and scalable.

Your job is to create **a lookup table** that BA can use to estimate lounge eligibility percentages across different flight groupings. This will allow the business to anticipate lounge demand without needing exact flight or aircraft details.
